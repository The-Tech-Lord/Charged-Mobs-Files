# Charged Mobs Files
Place where my friends can download the creations I make!

<hr>

### Things to Know
`README.md`: Will tell you about the application I've made and how to use it <br />
`Update-Logs.txt`: These files are used to keep track of updates that I make <br />
`SomeFileName.exe`: The executable file that you want to run <br /> &nbsp (Of course the actual file won't be named `SomeFileName.exe`) <br />
`Z_README` Folder: That folder is used to hold stuff like images for the `README.md` file that you are reading right now

<hr>

## How to Download an Executable File

1. Click on the folder which contains the file you want to download:
![Snake Game Folder](./Z_README/Snake-Game-Folder.png/)
We will be using the **Snake Game** folder for this demonstration. Ignore the **Z_README** folder, that stores the images for the `Z_README.md` file that you are watching right now.
1. Click on the file that ends in `.exe`:
![Snake Game Files](./Z_README/Snake-Game-Files.png/)
1. Click the `Download` Button:
![How To Download a File](./Z_README/How-To-Download-File.png/)

## How to Keep / Run the Executable File

**Internet Explorer**:

* Click the `Save` button or the `Run` button
* Click the `Actions` button
* Click the `More Options` dropdown button
* Press `Run Anyway` (This is a one time step for each download)

**Microsoft Edge**:

* Click the three dots next to the button `Delete`
* Select `Keep`. You will then be redirected to the Microsoft Edge `Downloads` Page
* A pop-up will occur. Click on `Show More` and select `Keep Anyway`

**Google Chrome**:

* Click the arrow next to the button `Discard`
  * If there isn't a `Discard` button just click the arrow

**Firefox**:

## How to Always be able to Run the File

**Windows**:

Once you have followed these steps according to your browser, go to where ever you downloaded the .exe file and click on it, once you do that, on Windows, a prompt will tell you that it blocked the .exe file (**This even happens in Administrator mode**). <br />

<br /> To get around this click where is says `More Info`, you will then get an option called `Run Anyway`. You are now able to run the file to your heart's desire!!
